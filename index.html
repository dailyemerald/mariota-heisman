                    <p>Preseason predictions immediately began to forecast Oregon as a national title contender and him as a sure bet to be the first pick in the 2015 Draft. As September approached, the media coverage on the reserved Hawaiian native was at a maximum. Seemingly each day something new about an individual who prefers his privacy was nationally publicized and just a few weeks into the regular season, his face was already gracing the cover of Sports Illustrated. It wasn’t as if that was a symbol of his march to fame though – considering the fact that it was the third time he appeared on the magazine’s front page.</br>
                        </br>Heading into the 2014 season, Mariota’s resume was already fully decorated and his career stat line was expected to set a large variety of school and conference records. Then by the second week of the season, his preseason Heisman stock was already being validated. Playing in what had been dubbed as the best nonconference matchup of the season, Mariota passed for 318 yards and three touchdowns – adding 42 yards on the ground – while guiding Oregon to a comeback win over Michigan State, 46-27.</p>

                <p>Showing off his natural presence in the pocket and eluding defenders with such a calming demeanor, the third-year starter made it clear why he was the Heisman front runner heading into the season. When asked after the game, even his coach, Mark Helfrich, couldn’t sum up definitive words to describe the performance he had just witnessed. Simply put, Helfrich stated, “I should have to pay to watch that guy play football.” Fast-forward to this point in December and Mariota – albeit one shortcoming in the Ducks’ loss to Arizona on Oct. 2 – has virtually followed the path of every Heisman winner before him this century.</br>
                    </br>Averaging 9.25 yards per play, he ranks just behind Jameis Winston and Sam Bradford among Heisman winners in the modern era and his 67.1 completion percentage ranks fourth among the past 12 quarterbacks to win the award. He’s totaled over XXXX yards of offense and XX touchdowns, displaying a level of efficiency (passer rating of 184.8) that has NFL scouts crowding the press boxes of every venue he appears in.
