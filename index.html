                    <p> As the sunlight dimmed on a densely packed, yellow-clad crowd at Autzen Stadium, the collective mood became increasingly anxious. Oregon had dominated early on, scoring on three of its first five possessions to send the sold out stadium into a frenzy. But, seventh-ranked Michigan State took control in the second quarter. The Ducks’ 18-7 lead evaporated, and as the game trudged along, Michigan State scored 20 unanswered points to gain a 9-point advantage.
</br> 
</br>               
                    With just over 20 minutes remaining in regulation, quarterback Marcus Mariota stood behind center. Oregon had gone scoreless on its last five drives and was facing a third-and-11 at its own 41-yard line.Following the snap, the Michigan State defense surged toward Mariota like a wave.  
                    Calmly, he eluded the first two defenders and escaped the pocket &mdash; and rather than sprinting downfield, he shoveled the ball to his running back Royce Freeman for a 17-yard gain and a first down.  
</br> 
</br>                    
                   The play wasn’t flashy. It didn’t show off his arm or his speed. Yet, one subtle improvisation changed the course of the game and demonstrated why Mariota is considered by many to be the frontrunner for this year’s Heisman Trophy.
</br>
</br> 
                    Oregon would go onto defeat No. 7 Michigan State 46-27 and Mariota’s 318 yards passing and 42 rushing yards set an offensive pace that would not slow down for the rest of the season.

                    This season, Mariota has totaled XXX yards of offense and XX touchdowns. In addition he’s lead the Ducks to a 12-1 record, a Pac-12 Championship and a likely spot in the inaugural College Football Playoff.
</br>
</br>
                    And it was that moment during the Michigan State game that ignited Mariota’s track for the rest of the season.
</br>
</br>
                    After the game, head coach Mark Helfrich couldn’t even muster the words to describe the performance he had just witnessed.
</br>
</br>
                    “I should have to pay to watch the guy,” Helfrich said.

                    Ever since Mariota announced that he would come back to the University of Oregon for his redshirt junior year, the 6-foot-4, 219-pound quarterback has been embedded in the Heisman Trophy conversation.    
</br>               <img src="img/mariota.svg" id="mar" class="col-md-2" class="">
</br>               
                    Before the season started, Oregon was expected to beforecasted as a national title contender and Mariota was forecasted predicted to be the first pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.
</br>
</br>                   
                    As September approached, the media coverage on the Hawaii native was at a maximum. 
</br>
</br>                 
                    Despite his quiet nature &mdash; he told reporters just days before the season began he likes to keep his “personal life private” &mdash; it seemed every day a new headline was published about the quarterback. National news organizations like ESPN, USA Today and The New York Times infiltrated Eugene. Just a few weeks into the regular season, Mariota's face graced the cover of Sports Illustrated for the third time.
</br>
</br>               
                    What wasn’t mentioned though, was the fact that Mariota was without his two leading wide receivers from 2013 and a left tackle, Tyler Johnstone, who had protected his blindside in every game Mariota had played at Oregon before this season.
</br>
</br>
                    There were moving parts everywhere and the one stable component found himself in the middle of it all.

               Fast-forward to this point in December and Mariota has followed the path of every Heisman winner before him this century.
</br>
</br>
Averaging 9.31 yards per play, he ranks just behind Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston and Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford – at the time of the vote – among Heisman winners this century. His 68.6 completion percentage ranks second among the last 12 quarterbacks to win and his 190. 2 passer rating this season makes him the most efficient passer to campaign for the award.  
</br>
</br>
In his three years as a starter he’s set seven school records and has become  only the fifth player in college football history to pass for 9,000 yards and rush for 2,000. 
</br>
</br>
Add in the fact that he’s the leader of a team headed to the College Football Playoff and it's apparent that Oregon would not be in it’s current position without the star quarterback.
</br>
</br>
Mariota has guided a unit full of underclassmen to the rank of 11th in the nation in passing yards (307.1) and fourth in points per game (45.9) --  all without the players who gained 70 percent of Oregon’s receiving production last year.
</br>
</br>
“In terms of leadership, that’s the biggest area he’s improved in,” said Fox College Football reporter Bruce Feldman, who recently released his latest book, The QB, The Making of Modern Quarterbacks. “You see all the youth around him and that’s really what stands out.”
</br>
</br>
His personality is a contrast compared to recent Heisman Trophy winners. Mariota, who was once described by his former teammate Kenjon Barner as “Hawaii cool,” doesn’t revel in any of his accomplishments. He ends every touchdown with simple handshakes and has been there for his teammates just as much off the field as he is on the field.
</br>
</br>
“He’s always shaking people’s hands, never goofing around on the sidelines,” reserve tight end Koa Kai’ai said. “Off the field he’s gone to help me or save me from trouble whenever I’ve needed it.”
</br>
</br>
In 2013, The Oregonian reported that Mariota showed up at Ka’ai’s doorstep at 1 a.m. because Ka’ai had “a bad day.” 
</br>
</br>
It’s a striking difference between a contingent of past Heisman winners, who have been as much known for their off-field issues as their on-field performance. Recipients like Cam Newton (2010) and Jameis Winston (2013) made headlines for off-field investigations of an alleged NCAA violation and a sexual assault investigation, respectively. Mariota has taken a much quieter route.
</br>
</br>
In his three years at Oregon, the only negative off-field headline about him came in November, when he received a traffic citation for going 80 mph in a 55 zone.
</br>
</br>
He’s mirrored past Heisman winners’ ability on the field, but as his teammates indicate, has acted in a manner completely opposite off of it. 
</br>
</br>
“I think really his only mission is with the team.,” senior linebacker Derrick Malone said. “What really does set him apart from everyone else is that he sees the bigger picture and knows what he wants to accomplish and that’s for our team to win each and every game we play.”
</br>
</br>
An example of this came in Oregon’s final regular season game against Oregon State. He amassed 404 yards and six touchdowns in a 47-19 win. But after the game, Mariota deflected the praise towards his teammates.
</br>
</br>
“This is a team sport,” he said. “Without those guys, we wouldn’t be where we are at today."
