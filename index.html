                    <p>Preseason predictions immediately began to forecast Oregon as a national title contender and him as a sure bet to be the first pick in the 2015 Draft. As September approached, the media coverage on the reserved Hawaiian native was at a maximum. Seemingly each day something new about an individual who prefers his privacy was nationally publicized and just a few weeks into the regular season, his face was already gracing the cover of Sports Illustrated. It wasn’t as if that was a symbol of his march to fame though – considering the fact that it was the third time he appeared on the magazine’s front page.</br>
                        </br>Heading into the 2014 season, Mariota’s resume was already fully decorated and his career stat line was expected to set a large variety of school and conference records. Then by the second week of the season, his preseason Heisman stock was already being validated. Playing in what had been dubbed as the best nonconference matchup of the season, Mariota passed for 318 yards and three touchdowns – adding 42 yards on the ground – while guiding Oregon to a comeback win over Michigan State, 46-27.</p>

                <p>Showing off his natural presence in the pocket and eluding defenders with such a calming demeanor, the third-year starter made it clear why he was the Heisman front runner heading into the season. When asked after the game, even his coach, Mark Helfrich, couldn’t sum up definitive words to describe the performance he had just witnessed. Simply put, Helfrich stated, “I should have to pay to watch that guy play football.” Fast-forward to this point in December and Mariota – albeit one shortcoming in the Ducks’ loss to Arizona on Oct. 2 – has virtually followed the path of every Heisman winner before him this century.</br>
                    </br>Averaging 9.25 yards per play, he ranks just behind Jameis Winston and Sam Bradford among Heisman winners in the modern era and his 67.1 completion percentage ranks fourth among the past 12 quarterbacks to win the award. He’s totaled over XXXX yards of offense and XX touchdowns, displaying a level of efficiency (passer rating of 184.8) that has NFL scouts crowding the press boxes of every venue he appears in.

            Add the fact that he’s the consummate leader of a team headed to the College 

            Football Playoff and its apparent that the third-year starter embodies 

            every attribute  the award has outlined over  the past fifteen years. 

             He’s clutch when it’s mattered most, his productivity is at levels unimaginable and 

             he’s done all of it while making it look as if every game is in his control. In big games, 

             like the ones against Michigan State and Stanford, he’s produced. 

            Yet, in some scopes Mariota’s path has taken a modified route compared to his 

            predecessors. His  humble and laid-back persona hasn’t 

            reveled in any part of his accomplishments and has never been one to accept the 

            credit. 

            It’s a striking difference between the last two recipients. 

            “The last two winners have swept through college football like comets through the 

            night sky,” Ralph D. Russo writes in his profile on the quarterback. “Mariota, a 21-

            year-old from Hawaii, has only made headlines for his play. And as good as that has 

            been, he is still a bit of a mystery.”
